# This is a house-keeping script used to organize our FASTQ files before
# running the grexome-TIMC-primary pipeline. It's probably not re-usable as-is.
#
# Sometimes we get several pairs of FASTQ files for a single sample,
# eg when the sample was sequenced on several lanes.
# Also, the naming conventions are always different.
#
# This script creates a single pair of "files" (symlinks when possible)
# in $inPath/../$outDir/ for each sample, with uniform naming scheme
# ${sample}_[12].fq.gz .
#
# Basically we want to symlink when there's a single pair of files,
# and otherwise cat @infiles1 > $outDir/${sample}_1.fq.gz
# and same for @infiles2 (in same order).
# NOTE: we CAN just concatenate multiple gzip files and get a sane gzip file,
# see gzip spec https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952 (grep for "members")
#
# We try to find original FASTQs automatically, by looking for .gz files
# in subdirs of $inPath whose name contains specimenID from the xlsx file.
# This is a bit fragile but we sanity-check as much as possible: we make
# sure each source file is used at most once, and we report at the end
# if every source fastq was actually used. Always do a dry run initially
# and examine the log! Then add --real to do the real work.
#
# See $USAGE for arguments.
